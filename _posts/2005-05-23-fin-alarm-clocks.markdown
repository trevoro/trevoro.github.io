My alarm clock didn't go off this morning. 

Now I know what you're thinking. When most people say their alarm didn't go off, what they _really_ mean is that they either forgot to set it, had the volume turned down, or they hit 'snooze' and went back to sleep. Rest assured (no pun intended) I did none of these things. I know this because of how much I rely on that goddamned alarm clock. When I woke up this morning - simply to check the time because I was wondering why I hadn't woken up yet - I checked everything about the clock. The alarm was set to 'on'. The time wasn't PM instead of AM. The volume was up loud enough. The radio station wasn't dead. What then, was the cause of my extended slumber? The only explanation that I could come up with was that my alarm actually HAD gone off, and I simply hit the alarm button and went back to bed, with absolutely no memory of the event. This is scary for a couple reasons.
1) Sure I was tired last night, I'm always tired - However, I've never ever turned off my alarm without remembering doing so. That's no good because I have to work for a living and being late is not an option when you rely on public transit. 
2) The _really_ interesting thought, is if I didn't actually turn my alarm clock off at all... What if instead of spending 4$ on fatal public transit trip, I was destined to spend a whopping 50$ on a cab. Perhaps fate saved my life by not putting me in harms way. 

Well its been an hour or so since I would have arrived in Toronto using the transit system, and so far I haven't seen any news reports regarding horrific accidents full of dismembered bodies and go-bus wreckage strewn across the street. I don't necessarily believe in all of that stuff, but if the fates kept me off that bus, I just sure hope it was worth it.
