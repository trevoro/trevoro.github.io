_Note: I'm leaving tomorrow bright and early, and this may be my last blog entry for a little while._

I was reading an article on [Salon](http://www.salon.com) (Adview required) today titled ['Life: The disorder'](http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2005/11/25/adult_add/index.html). Its main focus is on Adult ADHD and other such 'anxiety disorders' and their treatments, but the part I want to point out is that our apparent dependence on these drugs is causing or at least coninciding with the prescribing of even more medications.

From the article:

_"...If this sounds a tad too Huxleyian, consider this: Another recent Medco study points out that during the same period in which adult prescriptions for ADD medications doubled, there was an 85 percent increase in sleeping pill prescriptions for teens. The cause? No one knows for sure, but the most popular theory is that it just might have something to do with all those stimulants kids are being fed to focus on that test. "It leads you to wonder," Dr. Epstein tells the Times, "whether these children are being treated for insomnia caused by hyperactivity or whether the medication itself causes insomnia." It also leads you to wonder, Dr. Epstein, if medication to medicate the effects of medication is what we'll soon be touting as medical advances. Or, more pressingly, if we truly gain anything but superficial relief by continuing to believe the reason for the increased popularity of these drugs is to treat disorders as opposed to enhancing performance. "_

The article then goes on to suggest that because of the ease at which such medication can be acquired, that we toss it into the same category as coffee - a temporary stimulant, a way to increase your performance. 
I'll let you read the rest of it though. It's an interesting article.

I must note that I do not personally take any types of medication, but I know a lot of people that do. Certain individuals do require them, and others... well that's where things get fuzzy. I will admit that certain drugs, in certain doses are beneficial; But I fear the time when a daily routine consists of consuming cocktails of drugs on a regular basis.

It all sounds a little too [THX-1138](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066434/)'ish to me.
