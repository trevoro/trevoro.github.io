Whenever I built lego projects I would obsess over finding the perfect piece -
The one single piece I knew in my mind I owned but could never find. Organizing
and categorizing the lego wouldnâ€™t help, because I was 7 - so every time I
wanted a piece I raked through a bin of lego that at the time was roughly the
size of my body. Lego Theorist

Finding the perfect piece would take a really long time. So long in fact that I
often gave up and searched for alternative pieces, and what happened has
fascinated me ever since.

If I stopped looking for the piece of Lego I was originally searching for, I
would find it. In fact, this worked so well that I started purposely looking for
other pieces sooner to find the one I originally wanted - and it still worked.

Of course, this works for more than just Lego - you can find all sorts of
different things. Try it!
