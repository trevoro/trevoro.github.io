Yesterday I registered a new domain name for my first actual project, and my first order of business was to create a banner that wasn't a parked-page filled with advertisements. I dont make any money off of that so screw you Godaddy (Your DNS service sucks btw).

I quite enjoy graphics design. It probably has something to do with the instant gratification you get from doing a good job. I thought I'd post the iterations of my design here to show you what kind of process I went through.

Finally I added proper shadowing for the badge to give it that perfect 3d effect, et voila!

Overall I'm pretty happy with the final result. It looks clean, attractive, and fresh. If you could bite into a logo, man it would be tasty. ;)
