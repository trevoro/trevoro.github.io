Hey everyone. Not quite sure how many people are still checking in. I haven't had ANY time to write anything on here, nor have I had any time to upload pictures, save a few. I'm really looking forward to getting a full day off so I can plan these things. There just isn't enough time to do everything I want, so unfortunately the picture uploads get pushed down the bottom of the list.
Anyway sailing has been really fun. It's quite a different experience from anything I've done so far, and getting everything to work like a perfect machine is always satisfying. The work is incredibly hard, and it's taking a physical toll on me, but I can't help but feel it's a healthy change and a healthy experience. _Real_ hard work that makes you appreciate the little simplicities and the beautiful moments. You can't have the good without the bad, right?

Hopefully everyone's having a great New Year so far, and if you're feeling gloomy, the lunar new year is right around the corner, so you can have *something* to look forward to anyway. ;)

I'd love to hear what you're all up to! Write me if you have the chance!
