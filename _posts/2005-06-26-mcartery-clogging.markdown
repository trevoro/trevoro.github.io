My job requires me to do shift work. It's hell on earth, and to be honest I'm not quite sure that I can do it much longer. I've been working the night shift for the last few days, (10pm-8am) and it hasn't been going so well. Normally 10 hours isn't that long of a shift, but when its dark out, and theres no escape, you suddenly realized your trapped. (This is where I do a mime-impression of me trapped in a box)

Har Har

So this morning at 6 am I was DYING for some food. My workplace is pretty high-class. There's tons of stuff to snack on. Like soda crackers... and soda crackers. Did I mention we get all the free soda crackers we want? I decided that instead of filling up my stomach with one form of useless crap I would fill it up with another. I would make the ultimate sacrifice and walk a whopping 4 city blocks to get to Mcdonalds at 6am. Now, I've never been to a McDonalds that early - In fact I RARELY ever go - but you'd sort of assume that at 6 the breakfast food would be _relatively_ fresh. Don't kid yourself people. It was the greasiest, heaviest breakfast I've ever eaten. And I loved it. That probably has more to do with the fact that I was willing to eat a dogs ass at that moment in time, other than the fact that McD's whips out great food - because it obviously doesn't. 2 hours later I was wondering whether or not i'd made the right choice. Perhaps the soda crackers would have been better. 

Tonight should be easier. I went up to Dundas and wandered around until I saw 'Shawarma 2 Go' perhaps one of the best greek places in Toronto. Small. Cheap. Tasty, and fresh.
