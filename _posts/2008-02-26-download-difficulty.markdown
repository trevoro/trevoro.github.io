I hate user registration pages in general, especially if it's to download software.

I've been working closely with Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris lately, and I had to grab copies of SXDE and Solaris10 again today from the Sun website.

What a pain in the ass.

Seriously, It's called 'Open' Solaris, but Sun requires a registration to be able to download a _free_ copy of their software. What is Sun really going to do with the registration information it gets from you when you download a copy of Solaris? As far as they're concerned I'm currently evaluating it for 1000 servers. Wouldn't the benefits you gain in opening up your distribution channels outweigh the value of the statistics you'd get from requiring someone to log in?

If you want everyone to use your stuff, you have to make it *really* easy to get. If a client, be that a computer or a person can't grab copies of your software in 1 easy step - Click - then you're doing too much to prevent them from using it. If an EULA is your concern then put it at the boot prompt.

I want to see the numbers on the pros and cons.

Seriously.

Seriously.
