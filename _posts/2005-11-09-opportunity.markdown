![Soren Larsen](http://www.isystech.net/images/soren_small.jpg)
I was told today that I could crew on a tallship - the Soren Larsen (see photo) for 4 months beginning at the end of november. I have a couple weeks to decide for sure. 
It would be extremely hard work, with very little (virtually no) pay, however I'd have accomodation and food all taken care of, and I'd _really_ be doing something I'd normally never do. I should dive right in, but I have my reservations. 
(I am a geek, after all - I hate going through the withdrawl of not using my toys for awhile.) 
The 4 month tour would involve some refit work, learning how to maintain a wooden vessel, swabbing the deck cabin-boy style, learning sailing techniques, etc. I think it would be a good experience. The ship goes on an 8 month pacific voyage following the 4 month NZ tour. The crew is full at the moment, but who knows. Something could fall into my lap. Now that would be exciting. 
Sailing is something that's always appealed to me, although I don't tend to talk about it much. Much of my motivation for going to school and getting a job was to be able to fulfil the financial aspect for my romantic idea of sailing around the world.

As most people I like to think that everything has a purpose, that things have reason. This opportunity has presented itself, and at the same time, I haven't been able to get a job doing IT, simple office work, or even construction. Maybe this is it. 
The skipper even said they don't normally take 'green' people like me, and I'd be an extra crewmember. 
I want it, so why am I hesitating?

Btw all your comments are intruiging and interesting. A lot of people actually visit this site (which blows my mind) but the comments transform the page into more of an interaction. Thank you.
