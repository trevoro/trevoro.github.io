I'm terrible at starting posts and then not finishing them, and I can't even remember what I was writing about at the time, now that so much of it has passed. To be fair I haven't included nearly half of them, but after reading them over I've come to the conclusion that I'm a terrible writer when I'm drunk.

The following is a list of posts that I never finished, but I believe have some value, no matter how little.


### POST #7


Disclaimer: Okay. It's "Serious" post time.

I've been working at a full-time job in downtown Toronto for 2 months today.

Coming from a rather small town, this is kind of an odd experience. It's not my first time being or working in the area, but being downtown so often sort of leaves its mark. I find myself becoming hardened to things I see or hear - people I run into. I think the problem is the selfish attitude so many people have in this area, which is an odd phenomenon unto itself. When you think about it, people are Selfish because they believe other people will take advantage of them. Sure there are some people who are downright Greedy, but for the most part, people aren't Asses.
When I see homeless people on the street I make an effort to make eye-contact, sort of say 'No, sorry I don't have any change.'


### About Me


Well I'm going to start writing frequently and I figure I might as well provide my entire reader-base (1 person) with a short blurb about myself.

I'm a sarcastic nerd


### Amazing


[This](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/04/14/bc-dock-accident050414.html) story on CBC about a man who saved his 3-year old son from their families SUV which fell an astonishing 12 m into 8 m of water. This is the kinda shit that's one of those heart-warming stories intentionally placed on the front pages every nowand again to remind you the world isn't going to hell. But all I gotta say is 'atta boy.'


### Unplugging


I had an amazing conversation today with a guy that works at BMO ( that's all I know )
he looked like he was in his mid 40's and had had a couple drinks to be perfectly honest. We had amazing conversations about technology and inefficiency, and how nobody cares about employees.


### Time


Some people are worth yours, and some people aren't.
Unfortunately, it may take awhile before you figure out who those people are.
Much like someone noted awhile ago - The stongest binds can't be broken, but finding weak links remains a challenge.


### Where Are The Laptop Stickers?


I used to have a whole whack of stickers on my IBM x22 (My favourite old laptop), but after work bought me a Mac I refrained from defacing company property. I have to give it back and get my own computer, that I dont feel guilty about covering in stickers proclaiming my geekiness.

That being said, it's not exactly easy to find stickers one would consider to be 'laptop' worthy. Sure I can find badges of this or that the other technology.
