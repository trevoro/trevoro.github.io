Every day I hope and wonder if I'll see, hear, or experience something that will light a fire under my ass. 

_You'll never find anything when you're looking too hard._

I spend too much time looking.
I spend too much time hoping to read that one message that makes everything better.
I spend too much time wandering in the hopes of finding my inspiration.
I spend too much time Searching, and not enough time Being.
