[Last.FM](http://www.last.fm) is THE music site that I've been waiting for _my entire life_. The site makes use of Audioscrobbler, which is a piece of software that updates meta-data about the music your listening to to their database. This information is collected and grouped into categories such as the artist, album and the song your listening to, and how many times. Couple that with the other songs you listen to, the genre of music, the tagging that the Last.FM community is doing, as well as the similar artist search and you've got one kick-ass music site. You can search for any artist, and similar artists will be listed by popularity. This popularity is decided by the listen frequency that the collection of users are contributing. Obviously the more users, the better the results get. Last.FM also has a great open-source streaming program for listening to music. You can search radio stations by tag, or by artist, which suggests to me that they're compiling streams on the fly. It seems like a really awesome project. They're based out of London, England right now, but the music is from everywhere. I love it.
