In his latest [post](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1367&Itemid=125), [Michael Geist](http://www.michalegeist.ca) discusses the possibility of a new DMCA-like bill being introduced in Canada once the government reconvenes after its summer 'vacation'. Make no mistake - It's going to be a big deal, especially for people that are already using their fair-use rights to their full advantage. He has created a Wiki topic - which is open to contribution. He will also be posting an article every single day for the next 30 days regarding the subject. Pay attention - it could change a lot of how media is treated in this country.
