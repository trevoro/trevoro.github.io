Let me be the first to point out how ridiculous this is.

I dont want to get into the whole 'having a ring / not having a ring' thing but seriously. I can choose a ring up to 125,000 dollars? on AMAZON? Amazon. Seriously. Are they just probing the market? Are people really going to spend that much? I wouldn't be that surprised - I'd just be terribly dissapointed.
