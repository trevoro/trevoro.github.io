So I hopped on the plane to Vancouver yesterday. Suffice to say I have to say that flying for me is always an... interesting experience. I prefer it over other modes of transportation, mainly because its faster, involves less thinking, and more importantly, offers you no option of 'turning back.' When you're taxing down the runway, there's no way to get off the plane, unless you can have a heart attack on demand, drop your ipod in the toilet, or you say you 'have a bomb'. And I wouldn't recommend the later. Yes, flying is the most 'decisive' way to get around. Car's have breaks, and steering wheels, and we all know what those can be used for.

The flight itself was pretty enjoyable. I tend to get lucky when flying. So many people have told me nightmare stories about kids kicking the back of their seats, motion sickness, excessive noise, nonstop turbulence. Granted, I've only flown 10 times, but so far so good *knock on wood*.

The guy sitting next to me was especially nice. First he offered me his headphones, then he offered me a massive bag of starburst candy. That was cool. Then he bought chips, took extra complimentary 'Jet Mix' for me if i wanted them later, and that was it. He was just a nice guy.

Here's the thing though

I always get thrown off by exceptionally nice people. You're always forced to wonder what the other person wants in return. 'How many of minutes of conversation per Starburst, buddy?' I suppose that makes me an Ass. I also realize that this is a personal failing and perhaps paranoia. The funny thing is, IM the kind of person to do that sort of thing for people too. You want my candy? Here. You want a drink? Here you go. Interesting that some generous people tend not to accept reciprocal generosity.
