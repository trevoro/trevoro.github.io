Yesterday I asked on twitter what the best place was to get Pho in Vancouver. Turns out a lot of people like Pho, and the number of responses I got was overwhelming. (I wish that many people liked going on a date with me. *rimshot* )
Here's a list of places ordered by mentions, not necessarily by how good they are.
