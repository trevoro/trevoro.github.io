Well its micro-post time! I was discussing the recent events regarding China and Japan recently with one of my friends. Her rant seems to nicely sum up the situation. ;)


_"China is bound to be the player of the future, and Japan is a ticking time bonmb, their economy is based on false prosperity, their culture is centred around an emperial lifelstyle that was crushed with WWII and even their core religious beleifs are dated and protectionist... sooner or later they are going to need the rest of the world, and they are going to regret biting the hand that feeds them. The US has exhausted everything from Japan that they want, and therefore Japan has very little to barter with with the West, and by pissing off the Chinese it is screwing itself royally, unless it is going to align with the Koreans and china definitely deserves a seat on the security council, Canadian treatment of aboriginals ranks lower that the treatment of the citizens of China by the CCP and no one points fingers at us.... its such a massive nation holding power for sucha  large part of the economy that they definitely deserve a say.
so it ridiculous for the Japanese to say that they are more deserving than the Chinese... Japan just pisses me off because they are so small and so screwed but think they are still a world power like they were 50 years ago."_
