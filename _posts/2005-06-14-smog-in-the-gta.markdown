![Toronto Smog](http://www.isystech.net/images/toronto_smog_small.jpg)


Just a picture I took today, probably the most humid day I've ever felt. Of course, most of that humidity was laced with pollutants and acids. Anyway this view is off my balcony, looking onto a gully with a small creek, surrounded by trees. It's generally a beautiful sight, when compared to the boring grid of houses we call suburbia. Regardless, I thought I was going to see the reenactment of Gorillas in the Mist -- Better yet, the SNL skit with Sigourney Weaver guest starring as herself in the movie. Hilarious -- They took these spray bottles to make the mist. 
HA!

Seriously though, pollution isn't that funny.
