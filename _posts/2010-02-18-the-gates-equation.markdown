Bill Gates' [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates.html) went online today and I agree with [Alex Steffen](http://twitter.com/Worldchanging/status/9158396282) that it's the most important climate talk of the year (and will be for the rest of 2010). Nothing is more important to the security of our planet than reducing our carbon output, and the best way to do that is to significantly ramp up investment in innovative energy companies. The best part of the talk is The Gates Equation which does an excellent job showing how we have to reduce and eliminate our CO2 emissions. For more of an explanation on The Gates Equation check out the [WorldChanging post](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010976.html).




Providing Carbon Neutral energy is the holy grail, not only for the planet but for its inhabitants. Cheap, carbon neutral energy is the only way to sustain our economies, lift people out of poverty and continue our whole 'civilization' experiment.
