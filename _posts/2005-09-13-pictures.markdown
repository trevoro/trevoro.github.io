I've finally posted some pictures from my trip. There are only a few though. A lot of them are from I went on a Hike through the Tongariro Crossing while taking a break from snowboarding. Some of them aren't very flattering either. Haha. Anyway I'll get more uploaded once I find a place with a decent upload rate. I can't sit around for 3 hours uploading pictures.

Adios.
