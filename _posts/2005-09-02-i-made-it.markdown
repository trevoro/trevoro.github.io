![Flight](http://www.isystech.net/images/flight_from_sf.jpg)


Well I got to Auckland in one piece. After spending the last 30 hours or so on the road, I've finally managed to get the other side of the fucking planet. What the hell am I doing here agian? Haha. I managed to get some pretty interesting pictures from the plane. I was pretty lucky with regards to travelling. On my flight from LAX to Auckland I had a window seat and all 3 seats in my row to myself. Meant I could sleep lying down instead of sitting, and I think that made all the difference. I'm still jet-lagged to hell though. I have no idea what time it is back in San Francisco now, let alone Ontario. The picture up top was taken while on my flight from Oakland to LAX. That bright spot in the middle is Mars I believe. It's a planet anyway. ;)
I only spent about 45 minutes in LA, but one thing I can say about it, is that words don't do it justice. It's fucking ginormous. Auckland was warm today, but other than that I have no idea what my plans are for tomorrow. I can't see this screen properly let alone think about planning an entire day. 
Hi everyone!
