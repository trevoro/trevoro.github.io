I've read a lot of reviews lately about the Motorola Q. Some give mediocre ratings, with several complains about the scrollwheel functionality, and others are raving about how the MotoQ just might be the best phone on the market.

If the MotoQ were simply a cell-phone, then I could understand this statement. However, as a person that will use ALL of the functionality of a given device, the MotorolaQ is - for lack of a better phrase, a piece of stinking garbage.

Now, the blame for this cannot be solely pinned on Motorola, because the hardware itself is pretty beautiful. The keyboard is strange at first but once you've adapted its quite easy to type on. The scrollwheel could be set a little deeper into the unit, so as to remove the overhang on the right side of the body, and they could have used something other than Windows Mobile 2005.

I'm not quite sure what motivated Motorola to go the WM2005 route for their OS - perhaps development time would take too long (Not that motorola has ever made a pretty phone GUI) but Mobile 2005 is the most atrocious thing thats ever happened to a cellphone. The graphics are horrendous. Fullscreen support is non-existant, and it doesn't integrate well with the Q's hardware. I've mostly purchased this phone for [work](http://www.e-xact.com) purposes, however the Q refuses to run any of my java applets, and the version of Putty for Mobile devices doesnt run properly. Nobody has had much luck online with this either.

I guess what I'm really ranting about is the Operating System. Why, for the love of God, can't Motorola get their act together and create something usable? The features are there in WM2005, but the interaction is horrendous.

Case in point. The top menu item in WM2005 is an icon list of recently ran applications that scrolls horizontally across the screen. Beneath that is a list of actions and notifications that scroll vertically. When you use the scrollwheel, you dont have the option of scrolling through the (ugly) icons, it simply moves down to the next item in the vertical list. In order to be able to scroll through the most recently used applications, you have to move your thumb to the front of the screen to use the direction pad - thus changing the entire way you use the device. It would have been much better to have a click of the scrollwheel enter the horizontal menu, and then scrolling would select between those items.

However much it pains me to say it - I'll have to return the Motorola Q; It's simply not usable, and I'll give up the form-factor of the Q for the simplicity and functionality of the Blackberry.
