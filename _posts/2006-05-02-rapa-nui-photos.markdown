Hola!

Im stuck in Easter Island right now because of a 40 hour and counting torrential downpour. The pilots cant see the airport (and this spanish keyboard is pissing me off). Anyway after sitting here for 15 minutes I was able to upload just a handful of photos. 
Hopefully my flight will come in tonight some time, the Island is cool but I need an excuse for a night of sobriety.
