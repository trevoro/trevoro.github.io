An auction closed a few days ago on Ebay for a "Haunted Possessed Disney Stitch Teddy Bear." 
The seller actually wrote up a pretty interesting story about the whole thing. Apparently his efforts to ditch the haunted bear were in vain.





_"I had taken the teddy out to the landfill site just outside of the city limits, and buried it under any other debris I could find close by. It had been close to 3 weeks since we had seen the thing, and we were starting to think that the nightmare was over._




_In the early evening on a Thursday, I let our dog outside, just as we normally do all the time. After he had been outside for about 10 minutes, I thought maybe he had found some food, or something else to eat, as he usually does. I looked outside, and saw him laying in the snow, and he wasn't moving. I ran outside, and grabbed him, and noticed the Stitch toy laying beside him. Our dog was breathing, but unconscious. I rushed him inside, and called the vet. We were able to take him to the emergency clinic, and after examining him, we were told that they could notice nothing actually wrong with him. It appeared that he had just passed out, but his blood pressure was extremely high, and he was still having problems breathing. They kept him overnight for observation, which was good, because I wanted him kept as safe as possible._
