[![Breathdefying Pizza](http://trevoro.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dscn0343.jpg)](http://trevoro.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dscn0343.jpg)

It's been a long hard week, and everyone deserves to eat well. Before nestling in for your Babylon 5 marathon try this pizza recipe. It will leave you with the worst breath ever, but it's okay - You weren't getting laid anyway.

Step number zero: Pour yourself a drink.

Gather the following Ingredients

Pizza:

* Either a store bought boring cheese pizza or

* Buy a copy of the [Bread Bakers Apprentice](http://www.amazon.com/Bread-Bakers-Apprentice-Mastering-Extraordinary/dp/1580082688) and have some patience.

Toppings:

* One small onion

* Two cloves of garlic

* Two strips of double-smoked bacon

* 2 dried red chili peppers

* Half of a spicy chorizo sausage

* Your favorite Cheeses. I'm using Jalapeno Mozzarela, and Smoked Cheddar.

Steps:

1) Heat oven to about 400f.

2) Resign yourself to the fact that you're really going to put all of this on one pizza.

3) Heat up your skillet to medium heat. Cut the strips of bacon into pieces about 1/2inch square. Sear them in the pan to get most of the fat out and add some texture. Once they're done throw the bacon pieces onto a paper towel to get rid of the artery clogging goodness.

4) Dice the onion and two cloves of garlic.

5) Cut the chorizo sausage into as many slices as you want. This is the pepperoni you were denied your entire life.

6) If you've baked your own crust, add a thin layer of sauce.

7) Throw on the garlic and onions, evenly distribute the sausage and bacon.

8) Grate copious amounts of cheese.

9) Crush and add the Chili peppers.

10) Add herbs to taste.

11) Throw it in the oven, middle rack for about 15 minutes.

12) Regret nothing.

PS. I'm joking about the breath thing, but it IS strong. For the love of god rinse your mouth out, and stop watching Babylon 5.
