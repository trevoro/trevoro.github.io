What is with all these online banks and billing systems telling me I can't have a strong password?

The password I choose has to be between 6-8 characters and can only contain letters and numbers?

Twitter lets me have a superstrong password. It shouldn't matter what the length is! People! What kind of old school platform are you running this shit on?

I can confirm that TD Canada Trust is among the culprits, as well as Shaw's E-service center, and BC Hydro's online billing system.

Has anyone else ran into a company that didn't let you have a strong password?
