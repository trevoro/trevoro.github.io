I have a preconceived notion that every hyperintelligent, creative and worthy person will one day be invited to the TED conference. I hope to one day be lucky enough to go. As I was perusing the site today, I stumbled upon something rather unexpected.

Last year JJ Abrams presented at TED

JJ Abrams has created a couple of my favourite television shows. I was a fan of Alias since day one, and was captivated by the first season of Lost. I've since stopped watching TV, but JJ Abrams always stuck out as someone who mastered suspense, and the art of the ever increasing and overlapping plot line. Despite my occasional disdain for his lack of closure, JJ Abrams is a genius in his own right. His TED presentation is rather interesting, and made me reflect on a few people from my past who have had a similar affect on my life. *Awww*
