After going through so many changes in the last month, I've noticed something interesting happen. 
I've been able to see changes happening around me more and more. Opening up to the idea, so to speak. People close to me have changed and are changing, and I enjoy seeing it happen. It makes me giddy with excitement. People move, go on adventures, people grow. It's great! 
I love it! Did anyone ever read calvin and hobbes? 
Favourite comic of all time. 
Anyway theres one where calvin ends with this quote:

"Know what I pray for? The strength to change what I can, the inability to accept what I can't, and the incapacity to tell the difference." 

It's funny,  Laugh! You can take it two ways though...
1) You can be too stubborn to accept what you can't change, or 
2) You never stop changing
(I'll send someone something rare and expensive if they find me that clip!)

Become a witness to the the genesis of peoples lives, not just their existence.
