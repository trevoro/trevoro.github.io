So I'm trying to hash out the most important things to me, so as to give myself more direction. Here's a short list of things that mean the most to me.





**Sustainable Living**







**Green as a prefix**








**Fantastic Cooking**








**Communications**








**Clean Energy**








**Music**








**Education**








and **Technology** as the enabler of those things.








I've sort of realized that while I enjoy the details and knowing what happens, I'm more of a big-picture person. Stepping back to a vantage point to assess the situation, then diving in later on to pick apart certain procesess and methods. That's the way I work. So having a small list of general things that matter to me (some are obviously omittable) the question is








How do I tie those things together?
