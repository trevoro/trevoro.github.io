_From the 'Things that are neat to think about but hard to measure dept'_

I've been trying this thing lately. Every single time I sit down at my computer, instead of running straight for a website or my email, I try and write something first. What got me thinking about this was a thought I had about how most people spend more time online than watching TV, but the majority of those people are still consuming information.

Take a look at sites like Digg, Reddit, Boingboing, Facebook, etc. You can throw up a few pictures and vote on a few stories but for the most part it's like watching TV.Â You didn't have to create anything to realize the value of those systems - you just had to 'participate' by going there.

So what if you could measure the amount of stuff you consumed, and the amount of stuff you created?

Then you could come up with a personal ratio. So lets say for every blog post I write I read 100 websites. That actually seems like a reasonable ratio to me. So my ratio is


### **1:100**


But if you're not in much of a writing mood for awhile, maybe you'll read 1000 websites for every blog post


### **1:1000**


Something like this would be cool to track, and I'd be really interested in seeing what the averages are.
