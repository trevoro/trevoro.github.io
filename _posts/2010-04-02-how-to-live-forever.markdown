The other day I was speaking with an acquaintance who's grandfather had recently passed away. Most people have trouble talking about the subject, and all while the subject is generally sad, this story had a an interesting twist.


#### You & Mii


A few months ago Susan* and her Grandfather were playing Wii. As every gamer knows, its not quite the same to play a Wii game without a [Mii](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&source=hp&q=mii&gbv=2&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=) character. So Susan opted to create her Grandfather his very own avatar - at his discretion of course. After 30 minutes they'd perfected the essence of the man (playful in nature but I'm told had serious eyebrows).They then proceeded to bowl and golf in the usual fashion. They even managed a couple games of Tennis. All in all a great visit.

But Susans Grandfather got sick, and instead of getting better things got worse.

Dealing with the death of a loved one is difficult in most circumstances but this was particularily difficult for his family. The central figure in their family, he would often be the resolver of disputes, and the reason for their getting together. They attended the funeral grief stricken but mildly comforted by the understanding that a man with such a persistent sense of youth would no longer have to deal with the burdens of an ageing body.

A few weeks later Susans family was over for a relatives birthday. After catching up and eating dinner a few of them decided to fire up the Wii. To their amazement the character that kept popping up the most often was her Grandfather.

"It was as if he was still around, playing games with us", she recalled.

"As if he would live forever."


#### Perpetual Consciousness


If we could live forever what would that look like? While modern technologies may make it possible to sustain our bodies much longer than in the past, the fact is that our bodies are beautiful machines that eventually break down. Phillosophers and scientists have asked these same questions for quite a long time, and many movies and books have been based on the idea that a computer could actually contain your consciousness forever.

For technology extremists the moment that makes this possible is a predicted [Rapture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture)-like event dubbed The Singularity. The [singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) is a point in the future where technology is able to make improved copies of itself. The concept is that once something smarter than a human can make copies of other 'beings' smarter than people then "all bets are off" - there is no way to predict what will happen beyond this point because anything can happen. The singularity is in effect a moment where a machine can actually be conscious, and could contain other consciousnesses.

What does this have to do with living forever? Many people suggest that we will be able to upload our consciousness into some 'brain' and in effect 'live' in a machine. Whether or not its possible is pretty tough to answer. The singularity, much like The Rapture or Alien Abduction, is one of those things that cannot be verified by the living.

Perhaps the experience of the living is the only element that we should really be concerned with. If the memory is almost as effective as the real thing then perhaps an avatar is enough to feel a presence.

For Susan and her family, her Grandfather was still very much a part of their lives - able to play tennis with them at the press of a button.
