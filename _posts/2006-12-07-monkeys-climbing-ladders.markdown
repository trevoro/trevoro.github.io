Today I remembered attending an assembly hosted by two gentlemen who worked for Motorola. They were there to give a motivational speech about how you could be whatever you wanted. One of the pair mentioned how he wasn't the best student during his high school days, but motivation and passion drove him to be the 'successful person that he was today'
I thought those people were Idiots.

Now granted, peoples measurement of success is widely varied. The Motorola crews qualifying factors were that they were from the same small town as me, and had grown up to work in Chicago - the windy city - , sporting pagers, Star-tac phones and the original Palm. But not all of us were wired to think that way. From the moment I heard those speeches I couldn't help but ask myself 'Is this what I have to look forward to?' I never wanted to feel more connected to, or tied down by my work - I've always wanted to build something that made life *easier* not more of a pain in the ass. Isn't that was technology was for anyway?

Well I guess not. Turns out the economy is based on mass consumerism, and the latest and greatest thing is having a faster computer, or mind-numbing videos delivered to you at blazing fast speeds. And we the workers have all made sacrifices and compromises to 'get the job done'.

And I'm reminded of all this because as I sat down to read a book, I realized that I'm one of the monkeys with a pager, sitting on the bottom rung of a corporate ladder.

So the question is: When can I consider myself a success?

I'll consider myself successful, when I get back all the things I gave up to become successful.
