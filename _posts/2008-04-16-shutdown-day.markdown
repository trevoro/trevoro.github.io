I've been glued to my computer for about 18 years now. It's become such an integral part of my day to day life that I actually know every single time that I haven't used one. 3 times when I went away to camp, and for a couple weeks while I was sailing (It would have been longer but I brought my laptop traveling). One thing that I try to do is have computer-free Sundays but I usually fail miserably. This May 3rd, I'm going to try really hard not to use my computer (or even a cell phone).

Go to [http://shutdownday.org/](http://shutdownday.org/) and let them know whether or not you can turn off the computer, just for one day.
