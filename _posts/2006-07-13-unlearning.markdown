Back in College one day I was helping a friend of mine with a very simple computer programming concept. The idea was that you had two different variables, each with its own unique value. The purpose of the (very very simple) exercise was to switch the value of the two variables. My friend could not grasp this, so I drew out the following analogy, which was inspired by the first thing I saw on my desk.
Imagine you have two coffee cups, and you want to change the drinks that are inside them (never mind why). You can't simply pour the contents of one cup into the other, you need to pour the contents of one cup out, that is - pour it into another cup. You need a third container.
Okay the analogy was pretty trashy, but hey! I was trying.

Anyway the whole point of it is that today while meditating I came to a conclusion along these lines. Your mind is like a full coffee cup (double double) - full of ideas and habits. In order to adopt new ones, you need to first empty your mind; unlearn your bad and unproductive habits.

I kicked a whole bunch of crap out today to begin learning 'Focus' and 'Intention'
Don't ask me about the details - I may have accidentally kicked 'short term memory' out as well.
