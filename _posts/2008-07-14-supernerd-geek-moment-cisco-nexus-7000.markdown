This is the most gorgeous piece of network gear I've ever seen, and I didn't know data centers were entered in beauty pagents. It's the [Cisco Nexus 7000](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9402/product_at_a_glance_list.html). Sounds like a mainframe. Looks like a mainframe. Dispenses coffee and packets.
