Well the last couple of weeks have been interesting.
I've been witnessing other peoples progressions, I've watched mine come to a grinding halt. I'm trying to remain positive about all this, but I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that I'm PROBABLY not going to be able to find work in my field (Yes I'm still trying). I've had a bunch of meetings with recruiters, who all seemed super enthusiastic, and were saying that they knew people, etc, etc. You call them a week later and they've totally forgotten who the hell you are. It's extremely frustrating to say the least - my hope is constantly being dashed by people whose personal interest in my life is non-existant. I'm a nobody down here: nobody knows any of my old employers, my education means fuck all, and as far as their concerned I'm just some twit looking to make a quick buck. 
Commitment issues. 
I'd love to be able to work somewhere for a really long time, but for the life of me I can't fathom saying 'yeah I'll work here for 3 years' knowing DAMN well that I'll probably be bored in about 6 months. I need to be engaged. I need to be challenged. I need to be given a task that's practically insurmountable, and told to go at it. Just make it work. Then the creative ideas will start flowing, time will fly and I'll make a difference. The work has to have merit. There has to be a reason for it all. A purpose. Where does it all fit into the big picture. (And why do I care so much?)
Maybe I'm on that hippy 'What's the purpose of life' trip. 
Well what is it? 
I could easily manufacture purpose: I could get a really expensive car or a mortguage - requiring a nice fat salary. Become incredibly religious without becoming spiritual. I could get married, have a family. Those are all ways of creating commitment because its included as part of the package. People get married and have kids, and they're happy - but only temporarily. Something wells up inside them, and they slowly start to remember that something is still missing, which may be one of the contributors to the incredibly high divorce rates. 
And I can't accept that answer. I won't.
I won't manufacture a reason because I _can't_ repress the memory of its creation. I need to become better at self-deception (or apply for a lombotomy :p )
A lot of people suffer from this state of mind - that is, the inability to create purpose.
People who hope for something bad to happen so they're prompted for action (the [terriblisma](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/000089.html) people), to start over, people who wander as I am. People who drastically change their appearance in the hopes of reinventing themselves. I have nothing against them obviously - I'm one of them. (Although I still have the same boring haircut I've had for 10 years) I just wish that recognition of the problem would make finding a solution that much easier. 
Recognizing the problem might a first step. But this isn't an AA meeting - No matter how much I wish it, there aren't 11 other steps defined on a pamphlet to follow. 
The path isn't provided. When you start making your own decisions you're blindfolded, thrown into the back of a white van (probably a Dodge), and hauled to some jungle called "The Real World (tm)". Your blindfold is removed and you're then given a machete named passion (or talent or insert_redeeming_quality_here ) and told to make a path for yourself up to the top of the mountain. 

The path is created. Thoughts, actions, self-imposed restrictions. These are all either swings of the machete, or mud on the path.

Alas I'm rambling.
