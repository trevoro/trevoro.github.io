People are scrambling to write applications for the new iPhone. The iPhone store model really appeals to a lot of people, and the platform for Devleoping seems really easy to use

The funny thing is, if I buy an instant messaging application for 5 dollars, will I pay another 5 dollars for one tiny new feature? Granted, there's a lot of room to be creative, how else will people compete on feature sets and user-experience when the framework and more importantly - the amount of *useful* applications is going to be limited? If you're the first person to roll out an application for a phone, how much will people want to pay to switch? How will they decide? The most popular applications will be the first ones in their category. Lets just take the Instant Messaging category as an example. If I can support 5 different IM services, and I'm the first to market I win. Because the next team is going to have to have 10 different services (that you WANT), a way better interface, be cheaper, and convinced you to switch based on those merits. There's definitely a fine line between making money, and being ubiquitous - the best iPhone apps will do both.
