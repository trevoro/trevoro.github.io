Going through old CD spindles I had stored away, I found about 30 of my mixed and burned albums from 'back in the day'. Each one of them is like a snapshot of my youth. Listening to them reminds me of moments, people, and memories I thought (and sometimes hoped) I'd lost forever. Never underestimate the power of music, and of the affects of being a pack rat by never throwing stuff out. :p
