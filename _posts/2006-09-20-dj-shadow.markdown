![Dj Shadow](http://blog.trevoro.ca/images/dj_shadow_small.png)

** Y**esterday I finally got to see DJ Shadow live at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver. It was awesome. Lateef the Truthspeaker opened, and it was illlll. I cant remember what the entire set consisted of, but he played songs off most of the albums, as well as some UNKLE stuff. The encore consisted of another UNKLE song, and Organ Donor, which made everyone go ballistic. I also accepted an offer from an online financial transation company, so I'm working too. I've also got a line on a nice penthouse in Vancouver. Something stranngeee is happenninngggg. Haha.
