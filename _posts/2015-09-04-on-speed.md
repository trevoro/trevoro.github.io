The pleasure of seeing how longs of companies structure their teams.
Speed matters a lot for startups. Everyone likes things that are fast.
Highly scalable architectures. Highly scalable infrastructure. 
Continuous Integration. Continuous Deployment. Servers that are marginally
faster than the competitions.

None of this matters.

A lot of people will say "it has to be fast" then go and build software in
estoeric languages as it justifies their original statement. The problem is that
they never asked "what needs to be fast" or "how fast is fast enough".

You don't need a server that can respond in miliseconds. You need a clean data
model. You need to ship features faster. That's the kind of speed that matters.
