Hi All!

I've got some pictures from the Southern Ocean passage, and Easter Island! 
Links are here.

update: I barely took any pictures while I was in Chile. I was too busy staring at all the beautiful people and places. Cameras are just a pain in the ass, they ruin the experience sometimes. Anyway. [here](http://www.isystech.net/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=3935) are some pictures of Santiago and Valparaiso, Chile.
