I've used [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) since Day One (Sometime in May, 1995).

There I said it. Lots of developers I know prefer Emacs, but I used Vim first, and I learned it well. My only problem is the extensive use of the Escape key, makes using your standard keyboard just a pain. With my previous workstations exclusively running a Linux / BSD flavour, I would [remap](http://www.xbydx.net/node/16) my keys using xmodmap, and call it a day. It made my life way easier and I appreciated the ability to make technology work for me, not vise-vera.

After switching to a Mac, I seem to have lost that ability. Nowhere online can I find a resource that tells me how to switch the ESCAPE key with Caps-lock. Many references talk about the actual inability to perform such an operation, and frankly Lucy, I'm a little pissed off.

Please. Anybody. Tell me how to swap these keys without using the .vimrc!
