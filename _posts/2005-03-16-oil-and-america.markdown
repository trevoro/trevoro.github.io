[CBC](http://www.cbc.ca) is carrying a [story](http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/03/16/wildlife-refuge-drilling050316.html) regarding America's recent decision to allow companies to enter Alaska's wildlife refuge to drill for oil.




Great.




This news comes on the heels of yesterday's annoucement by OPEC to increase output of oil by 2%. This morning, however trading of Oil futures shot up to $56 dollars a barrel, the highest it's _ever_ been. ([story](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=587103)). When will we as a society stop making compromises and start looking at the bigger picture? President Bush himself admitted that he was concerned about the 'Average American family.' And that's what this is all about. Sustaining the 'American' way of life. We went to war in Iraq over it (dont argue with me), and now we're going to destroy a precious part of Alaska over it. When will it stop? Instead of thinking about tomorrow, we - as a society - are making short-term decisions that will undoubtedly come back to haunt us. Maybe it would be better to let the price of oil come up now, so people adopt better practices with regards to energy conservation, because once we run out of Oil - or it becomes to expensive to use anyway - we're going to turn to alternative sources of powering our cars and homes. Nuclear energy is a great alternative, despite all the PR problems you've got - but it too relies on a finite resource. How long will it be until we run out of uranium?




Currently, there are a lot of projects going on with regards to finding an alternative source of energy, but one that myself and [Leif](http://blog.leifmadsen.com) find particularly interesting is that of the [Solar Tower](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66694,00.html?tw=wn_3techhead). Essentially it's a 1km high tower with wind turbines in the base, and a large area beneath it that's heated by the sun. The different in pressure between the heated area, and the top of the tower, creates enough air flow to generate electricity. They're supposed to start buildling the tower sometime next year, and hopefully it happens. We need to take more proactive steps like this, instead of destroying more valueable parts of nature that we'll _never_ get back.

[Here](http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/oil/) is some more background information from CBC on the pending (current?) oil crisis.
