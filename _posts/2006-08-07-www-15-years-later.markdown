Yesterday was the 15 year anniversary of the WWW (Not the internet you dolts!). The web is the most powerful medium of communication ever created, yet it hasn't lived up to its (and perhaps _my_) expectations. Every day people sit and waste countless hours reading fake news, browsing for porn, finding amusing websites, and scanning aggregates of information we otherwise wouldn't even think to ask had it not been shoved in our face.. One thing i've discusssed several times with friends and colleages is that the Internet hasn't really made the world a better place, it's simply accelerated the pace of change. That sort of acceleration can be echoed in almost all 'big' technologies starting at the beginning of the industrial revoluion. The products, or services rednered by new technology haven't made people happier, or the World a better place, they've simply accelerated the pace of change itself. How can, and why hasn't, a technology as pervasive as the Internet been able to change the World? The Toronto Star ran a great article about the Web, and where it's taken us, or more specifically where it hasn't, and they raise several interesting points. From the article:

_"And, sadly, not one scientific breakthrough can be attributed to Web-accelerated exchanges of research data. Nor has peace and greater mutual understanding broken out in the Middle East, Darfur, or among the combatants in the fledging war between Ethiopian and Somalia.  Bloggers, mostly one-person operations with no reporting staff, scalp much of their content from the mainstream publications and network broadcasts they mock for their slow-footedness. Bloggers have not set the agenda in politics, science or any other realm. "The blogosphere is not a hothouse where brilliant new ideas are generated by the self-described iconoclasts who populate it," says Rick Salutin, media critic at __The __Globe and Mail_. _"The main qualification for blogging is that you failed to get a mainstream media job. Writers on the Web tend to be in touch only with other bloggers, not people in the street. It still takes a grassroots movement to force a fundamental change in social conditions." ([thestar.com - "the world wide whatever"](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1154814633513&call_pageid=970599119419))_

Bloggers for the most part generate barely any new content, they simply add criticism or opinion to news that's been reported by top-down news sources. And yes I realize I just did that. However there **are** interesting sites that foster and encourage original thought. Groups like [Well](http://www.well.com) offer a lot of interesting and original thought. The problem is it's actually kind of HARD to find that content. Most people I talk to haven't heard of these sites, despite the Well having existed since 1985.

An interesting observation concerning habits on the web, is that Popularity drives the current concensus among it's users. Here's what I mean. Site's like [Digg](http://www.digg.com), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), [NewsVine](http://www.Newsvine.com), and [Del.Icio.us](http://www.del.icio.us) are driven by user-generated content, and moderated by users themselves. While the idea of having user-generated content seems democratic by nature, what can't be ignored, and more specifically what needs to be addressed is what ends up happening with that information. What benefits does having a stream of 'interesting' information have for a person sitting on the other end of the screen? The odd tutorial is mildly helpful, but I've never read digg or [popurls](http://www.popurls.com) and said "Wow! That's EXACTLY what I needed! Amazing!" Instead, you simply are shown what most people are reading about, and damnit, you should too!

The problem I have with the Internet in its current form, is it's not living up to it's expecations in terms of increasing peoples quality of life by giving people more flexibility in their work day, or providing people with _useful_ information they woudln't otherwise know about. In fact, I belive that in its current form the 'net is alienating poeple from their own ability and need to be social creatures (see [7 reasons the 21st Century is Making you Miserable)](http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/misery.html)

Because of the constantly increasing complexity of technology, and the problems that we are currently facing as a society, there will be very little room for individuals to contribute independent solutions. As such, a hive-mind like thought process is required. I'm not talking about wet-ware like interfaces -- people aren't computers -- simply the need to encourage discussion, education, and participation, rather than the current thoughtless information stimulation that seems to be taking place today.

As a technologist I sincerely do believe that it can help make our lives better. Medicine, while not without its flaws, has greatly inreased the length and quality of many peoples lives. Why can't wireless communications, laptops and the web?
