Seriously what the hell is this?

**Update**: OK I uploaded an image with the same name and wordpress wrote over the old one. Grr. (There used to be a picture here)
Do I have to take you people out back and beat you with a 2x4?Â  Its the freakin' internet! Everyone's a citizen! The world at your fingertips, and you're going to limit where I can see the video from? What's the matter? To many people want to watch your awesome content? Nahhh fuck 'em. At least I don't have to put up with the stupid [Yahoo! 60 Minute](http://60minutes.yahoo.com/) page, where they break a 15 minute video segment into 10 pieces and make you watch an ad at the beginning of each one. This is the kind of 'feature' that somebody thought was neat. Probably the same people that think websites created with [Frontpage](http://www.chips.navy.mil/archives/00_jan/frontpage.jpg) are 'neat'. What if I'm an expat and I want to watch the news service I so diligently subscribe to while at home? Nope. It doesn't matter, you dont count unless you're within the magical line drawn on the magical paper.

There are ways to get around this problem, but it doesn't always work. Either way it boils down to using a proxy that exists in the country that actually is allowed to view the video you want to watch. [Proxy4Free](http://www.proxy4free.com/) is a handy list of proxies. One other method I've used a few times, but has less than 100% success rate is using [google translator](http://translate.google.com/translate_t) to translate the site into some other language. This of course means if you want to view your site in your native tongue, you have to either learn another language or stop caring.

Maybe I'm too idealistic, but is it that hard to not piss off your audience? Get with the program people. The planet doesn't give a shit where your content originated, if its on the net, it should be out there for *everyone*
