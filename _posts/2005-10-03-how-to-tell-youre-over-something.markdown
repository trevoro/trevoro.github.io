When you hear a song that reminds you of that person place or thing, and you're not upset,
You're over it.
When you can say you have no regrets and mean it,
You've over it.

I'm totally uninspired at the moment but please add some more in the comments... because two is really almost unpostworthy. 
Haha. ;)
