Well it took me almost a week but the fact that I'm here has finally sunk in. Shock, Panic, Denial, Remorse... all those feelings you never really want to feel. All experienced in rapid succession (not necessarily in that order). I've decided that I'm not ready to start working right away. It's going to make things a little more difficult, but why the hell would I rush back into a job? I have this great opportunity, I'm in a far away land with 1000's of things to do. Why restrict that activity to Weekends and after work? No job is as flexible as I want it to be, so I just wont work for awhile. A month, maybe two... maybe even three if I'm careful. 

Hostelling is interesting. Everyone here pretends to know exactly what they're doing but nobody has a fucking clue. Everyone wanders aimlessly. The problem I have is that there are too many options - What do I want to do today? Anything! I think that's what's scary : Not having a routine.

Im not saying that I want one, but when you've spent around 20 years with one you start to go into submission. 
I'm not saying I'm over it. 
Hardly.
I'm just saying that its good to embrace the fear of the unknown. 
Once you purge your routine, you realize what your real desires are. 
What do you truly want? I honestly still have no idea (with one exception)

I sort of hesitated when I thought about writing all this, but fuck. 
It's time to go exploring.
