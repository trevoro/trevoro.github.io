On December 23rd [UnsilentNight](http://unsilentnight.com) is taking place in 26 cities and Vancouver is no exception. UnsilentNight started in 1992 in New York, and has become incredibly popular, often attracting crowds numbering in the thousands. Participants carry boomboxes, each playing a separate track of music contributing their own voice to the sound that is UnsilentNight. To take part, all you have to do is bring along your boombox / GhettoBlaster (Yah!) and be part of the moving, block-long sound system. Of course you don't need to have a stereo to participate, but the more the merrier!
