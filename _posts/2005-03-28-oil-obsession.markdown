Last weeks rise in oil prices prompted me  to do an obsene amount of reading on the subject of peak oil. It was a subject that I'd already been familiar with, after seeing the (amazing) documentary entitled "[End of Suburbia](http://www.endofsuburbia.com/)".  The recent events surrounding the oil price hikes have prompted some more mainstream media sources to cover the subject as well. Most notably, the New York Times (free registration required, or click [here](http://www.bugmenot.com/view.php?url=http://www.nytimes.com%2F)), which is running a [story](

Rolling stone is also running [this](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7203633?pageid=rs.NewsArchive&pageregion=mainRegion&rnd=1111685363695&has-player=unknown) story, by James Howard Kunstler, who is featured in End of Suburbia.




I haven't been able to stop reading about our impending doom however perverse and macabre that may seem, I feel the need to inform myself as much as possible on the subject. A great deal of my time has been spent attempting to verify facts and figures, compare data, and determine whether or not sources are credible. After spending about a solid, hardcore few days doing some research, the issue of peak oil seems like an inevitability. The _only_ varying factor appears to be when oil will reach its production peak. Many industry analysts say the next couple of years, some say its already happened, and optmistic figures suggest 20 years.




Regardless of time frame, we should probably have more of an open-discussion regarding this issue. The consequences could be potentialy catastrophic (Read Jared Diamonds 'Collapse' to see what happens to resource depleted closed systems). We should be taking a pro-active approach to removing our dependency on oil.
