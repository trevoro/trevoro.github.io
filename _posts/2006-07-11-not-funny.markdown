You know, it sucks. 
I used to be hilarious, but ever since I went travelling I lost it. 
I think its because the brits / kiwis / aussies don't have the same sense of humour we do. 
So they just kept giving me blank stares when I'd say something 'traditionally' funny. 

I adjusted to their sense of dry witty humour.
Now I'd be hilarious in England, which we all know - isn't a funny place.
