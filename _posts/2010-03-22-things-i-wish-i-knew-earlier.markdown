We all know the sayings: 'Hindsight is 20-20', 'Everything makes sense through the rearview window', yada yada yada. If you could go back in time and tell yourself something I'm sure that there would be a LOT to say. There are things we're all better for because we made mistakes and learned from them. Other things ... not so much. Here are a few things I' wish would tell the younger me. Some are reminders, some are warnings. Either way here are a few things I hope I have the insight and ability to imbue my kids with, should I ever become a parental unit.



	
  1. Despite what you may see or hear, not everything in this world is a threat.

	
  2. Embrace your longing for adventure.

	
  3. Be fascinated by everything. Continue to look at the world in wide-eyed wonder.

	
  4. Being smart will last you about 20 years. Then you actually have to work at something.

	
  5. Don't pursue a post-secondary education until you've traveled for a year. You won't have an explitive clue what you want to do with your life.

	
  6. When you go: Go. To. University. NOT college.

	
  7. You know that Beetles song? All you need is love? Yeah its totally sappy but it turns out its actually true. Hold onto that.

	
  8. When you fuck that up don't worry - everythings gonna be alright.

	
  9. Being able to play a musical instrument actually _is_ a gift. Most people can't do it. Most people can't hold a note. Don't lose that skill if you can.

	
  10. Ideas are incredibly powerful things, but to turn an idea into something requires stress, strain, and sacrifice - and it's usually worth it.
