What's obvious to you might not be obvious to other people.
When we use the word "obvious" or "obviously" we can mean a few things.

 - Use it proceeding a statement to convey that someone else __should__ know
 	 something
 - In the previous case if you dont know something then you should question your
 	 intelligence.
 - When someone responds to a statement and says 'obviously' then you start to
 	 doubt whether or not your ideas or thoughts are worth sharing
 - Everything in retrospect is obvious. Its hard to tell when someone says
 	 'obviously' when agreeing with you that they thought of it at first, and
 	 elected not to say anything because it was so obvious.
