I've decided that I will now start replacing and posting pictures of the most hideous creature on earth as my Bio picture.

Why you ask? Why would you do such a thing? Why replace your partially symmetrical face with some abomination?

Because I can't find a job. All the places I apply to are obviously visiting my site and googling me -- having a unique name does NOT help -- so I've decided to play the sympathy card and pretend to be the "WORLDS UGLIEST IT PROFESSIONAL". That should at least get my foot in the door.

Hrmph.
