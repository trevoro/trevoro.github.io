When you're younger you look forward to certain events in your life. Your first kiss, your first love, vacations, college, a shiny new car,  a nice full-time job. Now that I've been through all those things (with the exception of the car), I find myself looking forward; but to nothing.
There's nothing exciting to look forward to. The future is extremely uncertain - and for a person that used to plan 99.999% of his existence, the future looks bleak.




I graduated college last year and now that that's over with, I have no 'Goal'; No motivation. My job is just that - a job. It pays the bills, but it doesn't excite me. I've bounced around so much that the novelty of a new workplace is quickly lost on me. The IT industry is a fickle one, and for some reason I can't see myself in this particular line of work very long.  It's not that I dont like IT, but I get bored way too quickly unless I'm being _really_ challenged, and I'm not. Another issue I've had lately is the setting I'm in. I live and work in the Greater Toronto Area. For the most part Toronto's an okay city, but it's not _my_ city. It's not a city I chose, it's just the closest thing to where I am right now.


  



Change is in order.


  



The struggle I suppose is finding a goal. One's personal motivation. I had one but recent life events have white-washed my plans like a big bucket of paint. I want to be excited about something again. I don't necessarily want to start over; rather give myself a much needed kick in the ass. (I've had kicks, but most were to  the back of the knees.)




I'm 99% positive I know what I need to do, but finding the courage to do it is the challenge.
