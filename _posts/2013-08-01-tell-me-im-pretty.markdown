slug: Make better decisions by understanding confirmation bias

One of the best parts about the scientific method is that negative results are
celebrated as much as positive ones. While a negative result is sometimes less
of a joyous occasion, having an answer generally regarded as better than not
knowing at all. Being impartial and viewing results without prejudice is the
hallmark of a great researcher. 

Unfortunately though, even great scientists are guilty of selectively
interpreting or ignoring unfavourable data. The same thing happens to anyone
with an idea they feel passionate about. This is due to __confirmation bias__ - the
tendency for people to favor information that confirms their beliefs whether or not
the information is true.

### Remove Emotion & Ask Better Questions

As entrepreneurs, this happens all too often. We search for information that
confirms our initial idea, rather than contradicts it. Some great entrepreneurs
understand this and search for a much wider variety of solutions to a problem.
It sometimes helps to envision opposing solutions to your idea, then figure out
what makes your solution or idea still work. This is why __confirming your idea
properly__ with a good customer development strategy __is so essential__.

Here are a few things that might help you overcome confirmation bias

#### Understand Motivation

When you're consuming information or discussing an idea, think about who is
telling you something and why. You should be especially nervous if only one
realistic suggestion is given.

#### Remove Emotion

Is someone totally in love with their idea? To be fair, passion sells product,
but love oversells and hate denounces. It's important to understand the costs
and benefits of strategies and solutions before you go and implement them. Be
aware of the [backfire
effect](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/).

#### Groupthink

Does everyone in a group agree? You should [probably be
concerned](http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/groupthink%20overview.htm). Given a large
enough group of people, you'll always have a dissenting voice. That voice should
be listened to, and their opinion should be taken seriously. You dont want a
group that's too large (design by committee - hurray) but you should be able to
be challenged in your opinion and be able to defend your decision.

#### Hindsight Bias

Are you looking through a lens of your past decisions? Its important to
understand that [hindsight bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias) 
plays an important part in how we make decisions.

You have to prepare yourself for surprisises. The good kind and the bad kind. I
consider preparing yourself for the worst and hoping for the best a "best
practice". When you understand that a flop or a failure is a possibility, you can 
plan around the situation a lot better than had you gone into something with blind 
optimism.
