I haven't written about it before publicly, but over the last few months I've been planning a trip. The idea was to make money, quit my job, sell my posessions, leave everything behind and just *try* something else. Try something other than hauling my ass in to work for a 12 hour day. Try something other than wandering around South-western Ontario looking for a good time. Try something other than "rotting away at the end of it all, pishing my last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats I spawned to replace myself." _(Trainspotting, John Hauge)_ ;). 




I see Ontario as a dead end. It's not what I want. There's nothing here for me. And that's just how I feel. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm dead fucking wrong. Maybe I have absolutely _no_ fucking idea what the hell I'm doing.  Maybe this will be the worst thing that ever happened to me. The biggest mistake of my life. But that's the chance I'm willing to take. So after seeing certain inevitabilities rapidly approaching, I made the decision. I bought my ticket, I quit my job, sold my posessions, and soon I'll be leaving certain things behind. No people, just things. That's an important distinction; you know who you are.
So I leave for NZ on the 31st from LAX , after stopping in California there to visit my bestest-bestest friend [ Paula](http://www.isystech.net/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=556&g2_navId=xc381dc78) in San Francisco, which is going to be a blast. The weathers going to be a bit odd because It's spring there right now, which I never thought I'd never intentionally expose myself to, but its better than going through another Ontario winter. Hopefully I can find some work (I have a few things lined up), get some snowboarding in, take lots of pictures, meet some cool people, bungie jump and not shit my pants, and just all around have a good time. Worst comes to worse, I come back to North America, having at least taken that leap of faith. I'll write as much as I can.




Wish me luck.
