So my friend John ended up making a ludicrous amount of money at one of the local casinos a few weeks ago, and what better to do with your winnings than spend it frivolously on a Nintendo Wii? No I can't think of anything either.

BUT

If I did have money, and maybe access to one of these, I can just imagine the type of sensational (pun intended) games that will come out.
