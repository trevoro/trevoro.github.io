[](http://blog.layerboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/joyent-layerboom1.png)I'm happy to announce that my company [Layerboom](http://layerboom.com) has been acquired by [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com), a leading provider of Cloud Computing services and solutions. Here's the [press announcement](http://gigaom.com/2010/07/15/joyent-buys-layerboom-to-offer-enterprises-easier-transition-to-the-cloud/).

Layerboom & Cloud Computing is something I've been working on for 2 years but I've been thinking about cloud since school. Startups require quite a bit of sacrifice, and this definitely wasn't an exception. I had to give up a lot for the opportunity to try and for that reason I have a ton of people to thank. Most of you I've thanked in person already, but here it is again for 'the record'.

A big thanks to our Investors for taking a chance on a couple guys with a laptop and an idea, and a big congratulations to the rest of the guys on the [Layerboom](http://layerboom.com) team for being persistent, forward thinking, and above all a pleasure to work with.

I also have to thank my Friends for being really supportive and putting up with my bullshit over the last 2 years; You're like family to me and in case there was any doubt, you're worth more to me than anything.

As part of our deal I've taken a job at Joyent and I'm really happy to be working for a company with excellent leadership and vision . We can't wait to show everyone the projects we're working on!

ps We're hiring, so if you're a developer and you're looking for a killer opportunity [send me](mailto:trevoro@joyent.com) an email.
