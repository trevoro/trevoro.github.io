It's too bad that here in North America, we dont readily have access to alternative news broadcasts. CNN Europe, the BBC and other channels portray a much different story of what is currently happening in the middle east, and while many people are very aware of the current situation, most lack the time, patience and ability to view stories from two different viewpoints. More presicely, the large majority (if not all) of North American Newscasters dont actually _ask_ tough questions - they simply want sound bites and move on.

That all considered,[this](http://brasscheck.com/videos/middleeast/me5.html) collection of news clips are refreshing. News stations asking tough questions, never backing down from statements that are false or make no sense.

I dont know if North American stations support Israel on purpose, for by in large their reporting sucks ass to begin with, but it would be nice if _actual_ news was being reported, rather than the opinions of whoever is on television.
