Michael Geist's article on [Clean Cloud Computing](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2685/159/) provides a pretty decent introduction to the [concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), as well as highlights a few interesting ideas about zero-carbon data centers. Of course, Mr Geist has his concerns about privacy and all with good reasons. Cloud computing has a lot of potential benefits to offer, but if there is a shift in liability to the company or persons operating a cloud, then there will be a very slow or little interest on behalf of corporations. Also, handing over your data to a third party fuzzes the lines about what they can do with your data.

Canada (and all other countries for that matter) needs a service provider that can enable generic, multi-purpose cloud computing who can also ensure the integrity and safety of their data and privacy.
