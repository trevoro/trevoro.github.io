If you haven't heard about it already, mineaction.org (which I believe is affiliated directly with the UN) has has launched a recent anti land-mine campaign. Their campaign includes a [website](http://www.stoplandmines.org/slm/index.html), as well as a phenomenal commercial, which you can view online for free. Here's a short exerpt from their main campaign site.




_ What would you do if you had to worry about landmines every time you went to the store, took a drive in the countryside or went to see your doctor?

That’s the reality for millions of people in about 80 countries. With such large numbers of people affected by landmines in countries that may seem very far away, it’s sometimes easy to forget about the problem.  Landmines may not be in your backyard, but they’re in the backyards of people all over the world. The United Nations is helping dozens of countries end the threat of landmines. You can help too by donating to have a minefield cleared.

The fight against landmines is a fight for the rights of people to live free from fear, in a safe environment conducive to development and peace. _


  



That's a pretty powerful message; One that should be communicated to the masses. If you've watched the commercial (Do it) you'll agree that it may be somewhat controversial. After all, little girls _are_ portrayed as being killed in a seemingly harmless soccer field. But that's the reality of the current situation. In case you were wondering, no media outlets have picked up this commercial, even though they're willing to pay for commercial time.




This begs the question, "Why?"




Obviously the media has experience with controversy - they report on it every day. In fact, controversial issues are the most hotly debated, and channels like CNN and FOX get their best ratings during the discussion of controversial subjects. It would appear as though these outlets are either reluctant to stir up a little controversy, or are scared of complaints by parents because their children no longer want to play soccer.




Are little girls going to be scared to play soccer?




Yes / No / Maybe. 


But some news outlets suggest they _might_ be, and are using that reason to excuse themselves from participation. If your daughter comes screaming to you saying she'll never play soccer again, you're going to wonder why. And knowing the sheer volume of television that children watch, it's more likely they'll see the commercial before you will. Realistically, there is more authentic violence on television every day. The odd occasion I turn on CNN, I get bombarded with images of dead soldiers, and the burnt bodies of Iraqi's. Why aren't people offended by that? We've become desensitized to violence in other parts of the World, to the degree that we've separated ourselves from their reality. What this commercial does is bring that reality home.


People wouldn't stand for violence if it was occuring in suburbia. If you had to watch every step you took for fear of blowing off a leg, you might think twice about even stepping out the door. 




It's a shame that more people won't see this commercial, because it would promote discussion of some critical issues, like why the USA hasn't signed onto an international treaty to ban landmines, or why millions of North Americans sit at home every day, and watch peoples lives end on national television, as a form of entertainment.
