title: Building Single Page Apps with Grunt
hidden: true
slug: Grunt, Yeoman, and Bower make it super easy to build and maintain single page apps

Single-page apps also have their [fair share of frameworks](http://caliper.io/blog/2013/Javascript-Framework-Popularity/).
These frameworks make it easier to get started and come with their own set of opinions about how they
should be built, extended, tested, and so on.
