I didn't know until today, but I've been a really big fan of [Louie Psihoyos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Psihoyos) ever since I started reading National Geographic back when I was a kid. It turns out some of my favourite pictures from that magazine are his, and I was delighted to stumble upon [his portfolio online](http://www.psihoyos.com/).

There are a lot of great amateur photographers out there. You can find fantastic pictures on Flickr every single day, but the talent of a professional is unmistakeable. Everything from the story to the lighting to the caption serve as examples of what it means to truly capture a moment.
