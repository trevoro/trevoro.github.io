![Easter Island Moai](http://www.isystech.net/images/easter_island.jpg)
When I first joined the Soren Larsen back in November, I signed on for 4 months as an extra crew member to help with the New Zealand season, as well as a refit period. Recently, the skipper invited me to stay on for the Easter Island leg of her pacific ocean journey. The trip would take the ship from New Zealand to Easter Island, along the southern ocean for what is sure to be a vomit-inducing 49 day odyssey. 
Will I go? 
I want to do it, but I'm scared. I get terrible anxiety when it comes to the unknown.
Always hoping for the best, but constantly fearing the worst. 
And while it's hard to remember, a way to get over that fear is to admit and realize that the worst will probably come to pass, but it will never be as bad as you thought it would.

There was a post today on [spirit-blog](http://spirit-blog.blogspot.com/) containing the following quote: 
'Do what you fear the most, and the death of fear is certain.'

If you've ever ran from something you're scared of, you probably know the feeling you get afterwards - A little bit of shame mixed with a little bit of regret. 
And while being scared of certain things is totally acceptable (I'd never voluntarily drive into the eye of a tornado) sometimes you've just got to face your fears. 

Decisions, decisions...
