Wired and the NYT are reporting that the US government has edited government climate reports in a way that downplays links between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. The reports were originally compiled by government scientists and approved in their original form by their supervisors. This is seriously Orwellian. The government cannot change the fact that major industries dumping CO2 is directly affecting our climate, by simply changing the report. What they can do is make it less of an issue by denying people fighting for restrictive legistlation with the information they need to make change happen. This type of short-term thinking is just what's going to put us in the dog house. Every decision should be made with long-term consequences in mind.
