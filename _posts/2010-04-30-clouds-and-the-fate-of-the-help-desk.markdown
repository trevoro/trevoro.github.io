As an efficiency nut there's one thing that makes me really happy about Tablets:

The Help Desk will be going away.

It's important to understand the meaning of the term "Help Desk". I don't just mean people who sit around all day with headsets, answering phone calls. It turns out there are a *lot* of people employed in IT whose job it is to just keep the lights on. Vendors, Integration specialists, Sysadmins, and the guy whose entire job it is to  click the right button to clear the printer queue. Entire countries have devoted a lot of resources to greasing the gears of computers. They all work in a Helpdesk somehow.

CTO's and CIO's are starting to appreciate that their function at a company isn't about technology _implementation_ - it's about how technology can help their business. Who cares if your OS is running Windows or Linux if all you need is a Word processor (and Solitaire). It's become totally irrelevant.

What matters is the applications that are delivered to the end user; everything else is just implementation dogma. The people doing these implementations are Help Desks too, they're just a few degrees removed from the end-user and prefer snazzier titles like 'Application Services Engineer.'

It's gonna take awhile. The PC will be around for a long time and [people still need to type](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-ipad-keyboard-dock/). But as we shift to tiny, integrated, crash-proof devices we need help desks less and less. The intuitive nature of the computer will suggest that it's no longer important to be adept at using them. Not only that, but as we cycle through generations of people, the technical citizens will supplant the [technical immigrants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer)
