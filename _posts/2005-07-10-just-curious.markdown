[Just Curious](http://justcurio.us/) is a website where strangers answer each others questions. It's a totally anonymous system, and only the country of the person asking the question or answering it is displayed. 
It's really neat.
All question tracking is done by creating a URL based on the question text itself, so multiple copies of the same question probaly won't occur (at leats with the same spelling and sentence structure). Check it out, it's good for a laugh or two, and sometimes its insightful.
