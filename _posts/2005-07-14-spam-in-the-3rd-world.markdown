[Worldchanging](http://www.worldchanging.com) has posted a pretty informative and insteresting [article](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003123.html) on the issue of Spam in 3rd world nations. Specifically, the issue regarding spam and other b/w chewing nuisances are impeding growth. While those who have high speed network connections dont have a problem dealing with large amounts of spam, the situation is much different in other parts of the globe. 
"It's a very different situation for many people in the developing world, however. The level of spam on the networks is as great (or even greater) than in the West, but a very large portion of those getting online do so with slow modems or in crowded Internet caf√©s that charge by the byte. A level of spam that might be considered annoying to someone in Los Angeles could be an insurmountable obstacle to someone in Lagos. This has important development implications: as more regional economic activity moves online, problems like spam, viruses and denial-of-service attacks can drive people out of business."
I'd encourage anyone that has a dial-up connection to start using gmail. Its amazing. If anyone needs an invitation let me know. 

I'm actually extremely interested in ways of bringing high-speed network connectivity to places that dont have it, especially in places like Africa and Rural Asia. The other day there was a bunch of activity online about a guy that had build a backpack with a built-in wireless transceiver, that bridged connections between 802.11b/g networks and Verizon's EDGE network. Those kinds of ideas are cool, but in places in the 3rd world there is no EDGE network to act as your backbone. 
What kind of networks can be put in place? 
I was thinking along the lines of having 802.11b/g for access, and having the new Wi-Max standard for a backbone network, seeing as it apparently has the ability to provide around 110mbps for 40kms. If you could build a nice repeater station that was battery powered and charged off of solar you could have something interesting. You could even write some snazzy routing software that could compute the best path in your wireless grid so that the fewest amount of systems are being used - or even include a method of distributing traffic so that if a system loses power you can continue your connection through a different wireless 'hop'. It seems like there are really a lot of possibilities. I'm really really waiting for a WiMax PCMCIA card to come out so I can do some serious testing. The possibilities are endless. 

I think one of the things that make computing so interesting and enguaging is its ability to increase the standard of living of everyone on the planet. In places like India we're starting to see it happen; Mobile phone access is changing rural India. 
What kind of changes would take place if everyone had high-speed network access?
In countries where there isn't an infrastructure in place to transport that data, wireless definitely becomes the leap-frogging technology used for that access. 

I know that technology surely isn't the answer to all of the Worlds problems, but I love, LOVE, the idea of a village being able to access information from the Internet. Providing people with the information required for buildilng wells, water filtration systems, and farming, all out of locally available materials, now that's some amazing shit.
