Like so many recent college graduates, I've been devoting a large amountof my time trying to answer perhaps the most important questions. What should I do? Where should I go? What should I devote my life to? There are certain things I can't change about myself - I'm a geek. So, I went to google and typed in 'What should I do?' hit the 'I'm feeling lucky' button and got this [article](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html).

Here's a short excerpt.


_Most of us don't get epiphanies. We only get a whisper -- a faint urge. That's it. That's the call. It's up to you to do the work of discovery, to connect it to an answer. Of course, there's never a single right answer. At some point, it feels right enough that you choose, and the energy formerly spent casting about is now devoted to making your choice fruitful._




Questions of such life importance cannot really be answered by any search engine - not even Google ;)
However, the article itself was sort of a reaffirmation; Sometimes you need to discover something that will help convince yourself that were you're probably on the right track.
