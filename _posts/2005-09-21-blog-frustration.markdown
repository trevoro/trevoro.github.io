The weird thing about having a 'blog' is that everybody and anybody can read it. I mean that's what makes it interesting I suppose. Technically I guess I could have some sort of limited-access thing - certain people get more information than others. 
Regardless, a blog is a type of 'journal' but this isn't an anonymous forum. 
This isn't livejournal.
Everything here is real, and you know who its coming from. 

I'm required to limit my writing on this site for that reason, and it's too bad. I'd love to really dump a lot of stuff on here. I've written so much in the last month that I could probably publish a novel... or a novella. One of the supermarket varieties. That'd be classy.

It's frustrating. I'd love to be able to share everything with you. 
I'd love to be able to sit here, write about something deep and meaningful, and have someone else go 'wow that makes tons of sense.' But it can't be like that. 
Even if I had an anonymous site, it wouldn't be the same.

All of that nonsense aside, I'm still having fun in New Zealand. Had a lot of fun in Wellington. I met some really cool people, and its a charming little city. Right now I'm touring around the South Island on a bus with a company called 'Stray.' It's a pretty decent crowd, and I'm seeing a lot of really neat stuff. I'm hoping to get a chance to get some more pictures online in the near future too, so you can all see what you're missing. :p

Thanks a lot for all your comments, it lets me know you're all thinkin' about me once and awhile, and that's cool.
