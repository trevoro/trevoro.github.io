Democamp Vancouver 4 was held today at the now infamous workspace.

Things started off with a hilarious session of BattleDecks, where two opponents square off against each other with slides prepared by an unknown 3rd party. The winner was a girl, whose name I am ebarassed to say I don't know. The runner up was  Jordan Behan. To his credit, he didn't have much to work with.

While the numbers were high for attendance, only a few people ended up presenting ideas, including

AdHack

Vancouver Expert Financial

Momentum Magazine, and

NetHooks

AdHack is a great idea, and was by far the best presentation. Momentum Magazine has some great ideas and propaganda regarding bike culture, all of which was positive, beneficial information, and NetHooks fumbled the ball a little, but it will be interesting to see if their LinkedIn replacement is worth all the effort. One person made the obvious Facebook remark - How do you get away with starting a social networking site in this day and age? The answer came down to focus, and that they were gearing the site more towards young professionals who are looking for internships / etc. I still think a Facebook application has that potential, but the search features need a little tuning.

After the presentations it was off to Flux for everyone but me, of course, as I had to deal with my day job.

The next Democamp is slated for sometime in early January. I'm hoping to have something to present, now that I've seen what the process is like. I'm off to continue work!
