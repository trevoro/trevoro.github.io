![Moving forward, looking back.](http://www.isystech.net/images/car_mirror.jpg)
I've resolved to commit myself to growth and the idea of moving forward. 
I get it. 
Change is the only thing I can be sure of, and I'm going to go along for the ride. I guess we're all along for the ride. But enough of that pius bullshit. I'm going to be on the Soren Larsen for 4 months starting on the 27th of November. It's going to be interesting. My crew handbook arrived here in Wellington today, and it looks like I'll be learning a lot more than how to sail and be part of the crew. I'll be sure to blog as much as possible while I'm onboard. Because the trips will only be for a 6-7 days in length I should have sufficient time to write. [as often as I do now anyways. ;) ]
Hopefully I'll be able to become a better writer during the longer trips, as I'll be leaving my laptop behind *sob*. Seeing as the longest I've ever gone without a computer was 6 weeks, this could be neat. I doubt I'll hold out long enough to break that record though. Every few days I go without being connected I'm reminded of how cool and powerful the Internet really is. 

Outside of that I've been basically just chilling out, and 'existing' here in Wellington. Been working at the hostel I'm staying at to pay for rent and food. I've become a janitor. Yes. A janitor. I clean kitchens and bedrooms. I change sheets and pillows. I clean up dirty old food, and rummage through couches for pocket change. It pays for the coffee I drink while I steal internet access from the local [CafeNet](http://www.cafenet.co.nz) AP at [Espressoholic](http://www.wellingtonnz.com/RestaurantsAndShopping/Restaurants/Espressoholic/Espressoholic.htm).
(To my defense, I told CafeNet they had a problem with their wireless access and how to fix it, but they still haven't, even after giving one of their net-engs a detailed description of the problem. No matter. I enjoy seeding music torrents at 3mbps)

My old [college](http://www.sheridanc.on.ca) professor emailed my graduating class the other day, asking us where we were and what we were doing. Upon receiving that email I suddenly realized that 'yup, I'm on the other side of the freakin' planet doing God knows what, and that's okay'. Once I'm back in Canada I'll be all recharged and ready to go!

I've also realized how much I miss snow today when I saw the picture of a kid on a toboganning. 
Damn I'm going to miss that. 
I'm also going to miss throwing snowballs at my cranky friends and relatives, the ability to store my beer outside, snowboarding, and having a great excuse to sit my ass down and play video games all day.

Well that's all for now. Shout out to everyone, and again best wishes to M on his x-country trip. I will do my best to post as much as possible, and include as many pictures as I can in the coming weeks and months!
