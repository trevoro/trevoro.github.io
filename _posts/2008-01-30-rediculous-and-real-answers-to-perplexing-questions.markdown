Question: Where do socks go after you put them into the dryer?

Rediculous: Its no secret that under the right circumstances the rotating mechanism used in the common dryer creates a very intense electromagnetic field. Coupled with the fact that rubbing fabric together for long periods of time will create static electricity, the charge in the middle of the dryer often hits critical levels. In more than 80% of cases, the center of the dryer becomes a poor-mans time machine, capable of transporting any object that comes into contact with the center of the 'time vortex' to an unknown time in either the past or the future. Although never observed directly, such time vortexes have been hypothesized in papers such as the famous 'Study of Black Socks in a Dryer for one Day' published in the fall of 1987.
