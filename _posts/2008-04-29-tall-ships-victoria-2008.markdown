Between June 26th and 29th Victoria will host about 30 [Tallships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Tall_ships), which if you haven't seen before is a truly awesome spectacle. From [Tallshipsvictoria.ca](http://tallshipsvictoria.ca/)

"Visitors will be able to walk the decks, touch the massive timbers, look up through the rigging at the sky, and turn back the clock to a time when our city's future was being built by ships like these. In addition, we are planning an ambitious program of interactive educational activities, concerts, craft fairs and festive events that will celebrate our history and BCâ€™s 150th anniversary."

Having [worked](http://trevoro.ca/blog/2005/11/09/opportunity/) on a [tallship](http://sorenlaresen.co.nz), the idea of 'looking up through the rigging' doesn't seem *that* appealing, but maybe I can weasel my way onto a day sail. Any chance to hike up to the [t'gallant](http://www.parl.ns.ca/woodenships/terms.htm) again! They should seriously having a day of racing, or at least plan a sail-past - Something so that people can experience ships as they were meant to be seen - on the water with full sails and landlubbers puking their guts out.
