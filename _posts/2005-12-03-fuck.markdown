It's too bad the internet sometimes gives you the ability to know things you never wanted to know. (ref: Old relationships)

Working on the ship is hard and definitely at the total opposite of the spectrum with regards to what I'm used to. I've been really struggling with the idea of committing myself to it - it's not an easy task. Living a really small space with 13 other crew and 20 other passengers is definitely challenging. Oddly enough, I'm being teased by my 'old life' which sits right next to the ship in the form of trendy bars and restaurants, cafe's and pretty women. While I'm working its a different world. As soon as I step onboard I'm transported to a world apart from everything else - where everything that happens off the ship is observed, rather than participated in. 
Everyone else has bought right into it.
They love it. 
I have my reservations because I'm oddly worried that I'll be gone for too long. But what's a year in a lifetime?
Anything worth having is worth fighting for, and soon this will become 'normal' - An attitude change is required in order to make this a successfull endeavour. 
I'll hopefully have some pictures up in the near future. Hopefully I can get some scary ones from the top of the masts for everyone. It gives me vertigo.
