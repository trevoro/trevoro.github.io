Hi everyone!

I'm looking for some help answering [some questions](http://survey.layerboom.com/?referrer=trevoro.ca) to help my company [LayerBoom](http://blog.layerboom.com) and some associated projects determine what companies and individuals really want in their own "Cloud Computing" environment.

I know the Term has been getting worn out, so to summarize, LayerBoom is providing software that helps companies build utility computing environments using existing hardware and network infrastructure. The idea is to provide software as a common platform, then provision resources across many distributed environments, and enable companies and academic environments to rent/share unused resources for extra revenue.

There's a survey posted up at [http://survey.layerboom.com](http://survey.layerboom.com/?referrer=trevoro.ca)

I'd appreciate your help and time!

-Trevor
