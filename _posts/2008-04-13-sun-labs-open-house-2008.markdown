I had the privilege of attending the [Sun labs](http://sunlabs.sfbay/openhouse) Open House in San Mateo last week. Sun was showcasing some of its new technologies, which included announcements about [new servers](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/09/T5140-T5240), as well as demoing new and existing sets of hardware technology such as the totally awesome[ Sun SPOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_SPOT) and some really cool research projects. Among those projects were [Project Caroline](https://www.projectcaroline.net/main/), a new platform for computing, and Project AuraÂ [](https://www.projectcaroline.net/main/)

_"Project Aura is a web-scale, open, hybrid recommendation system. It combines similarity based on the information "aura" around the itmes added to it with the social data commonly used to generate recommendations. By doing so, the project aims to solve the "cold start" problem associated with adding new items that are yet unseen by the users. Aura is an open system - any web site can contribute data and any web site can use Aura for recommendations. Users have the right to retrieve all of their data and to remove it from the system."_ 1.

Other talks being given were on the future of the data center, the Crossbow network virtualization project, which gives virtual machines line-speed performance with virtually no overhead, and [Radia Perlman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman) gave a talk on her vision for a distributed PKI infrastructure. Interesting to learn that the inventor of Spanning-tree is a self-described technophobe.

I'm working on compiling some more notes together, hopefully I'll have more up soon. Sun is doing some really awesome stuff.
