Everyone is different and we're all good at different things. But after awhile certain talents end up repeating themselves over time, and if you're lucky you'll have someone help you identify what they are.  Talents & Strengths are different than your skills. I know a lot about internet stuff, but I also know a lot about Sailboats. Those are vastly different things, but I (apparently) apply these talents to both problems. So I thought I'd share my top 5 talents / strengths as highlighted by various studies, tests, etc.

It's interesting to see how these have actually played out in all of my previous jobs, technical or otherwise, as well as the things I think about, the books I read, the people I know, and the goals I have in life. I'm sharing because I thought it was interesting. No set is better than another set. In fact I'd like to switch some. The question is this: Do you focus on what you're inherently good at? Or do you try and fill in the gaps? I lean more towards the former. I'd love to be able to sit down and pile through my taxes, however that bores me. I'll blame it on my 'Ideation'


### Strategic


People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues. Make sense out of seemingly unrelated information, draw conclusions, and make projections.


### Ideation


People who are especially talented in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena. Mind-numbing routines, processes, paperwork, or production lines sometimes bore you. (Ha!)


### Restorative


People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.


### Competition


_Dont know if this is a 'strength' ;)_
People who are especially talented in the Competition theme measure their progress against the performance of others. They strive to win first place and revel in contests.


### Adaptability


People who are especially talented in the Adaptability theme prefer to “go with the flow.” They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time. You resist being tied to predetermined plans and standardized systems. You prefer to experience life in the moment. You are eager to see where it takes you.

Okay I showed you mine. What are some of your Strengths?
