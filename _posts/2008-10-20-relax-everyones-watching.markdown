I'm reluctant to write anything remotely soul-revealing and post it online. Everyone's always supposed to be happy, all the time and nothing bad ever happens because we're all just so strong, and the rest of the time there's LiveJournal. I'm not unhappy, but I'm not happy. I'm just around right now. More importantly I just felt like it was time to write something that didn't make me sound like a robot. What, with such cerebral titles as "SOHO Cloud Cache", "Rogers DNS Hijacking", "Supernerd Geek Moment", and my personal favourite "Data Transparency and Queries" I'm surprised so many people pay attention.

Circumstances being what they are, I haven't been comfortable for quite some time. Don't get me wrong, that's a good thing. But sometimes I feel like a goddamned mini-wheats commercial (How's that for bad analogies?). The kid in me loves the adventure of pushing the envelope, and trying new things, while the Adult in me just wants a steady paying job and a place I can call home for a few years. But just like any cereal not covered in sugar, the safe side is usually goddamned boring.

Previous experience has taught me well. Anything worth doing won't be easy, and easy things are rarely worth doing. School, Travel, Adventure, Relationships. The tough things are the ones that resonate and define you and the easy things? Well they were just distractions. Sometimes things pile up and it's a little overwhelming. When do you get to just chillthefuckout? What's the line between foolishness and ambition, and when do you chase after something without question? Do you fight for Love or cherish Love lost? It's important to know people that make you feel truly comfortable, at ease and happy in each others presence. Attempts to draw on previous experience are proving to be futile.

I'm losing someone important to me soon. The fact that it's on a calendar doesn't help I don't think. Perhaps sudden departure would be better. There's no bad blood, no fight, no real reason other than an unfortunate set of circumstances, which if they didn't exist would mean a completely different reality. Part of the problem is probably because I ask too many questions, and postulate too many possibilities - 'What ifs?'

What exercise or elixir shall ease this relentless emotional curiosity?
