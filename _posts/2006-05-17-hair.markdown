So I broke down today and got a haircut. I was reluctant, seeing as my mop was present during most of my trip, and the highlights I had naturally acquired would be no more. The rather cute stylist (I went to a *stylist*) asked me how long I'd been wearing it 'Shaggy'. After telling her I'd had it for 6 months, she immediately escorted me to the basin and scrubbed my hair for a good 10 minutes. I didn't say ANYTHING about never washing. I washed it.
Once. 
Or twice.
You lose count when its that low, but seriously, it wasn't "Italian" greasy or anything.
