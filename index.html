      ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Trevor and I'm a self-taught hacker turned VP of Engineering who
      helps startups transition into resilient teams. My work priorities are to
      create a psychologically safe environment for my staff and peers, invent
      and create new solutions that eliminate
      <strike>bullshit</strike> drudgery ðŸ¤–, and to advance my field. By
      focusing on creating a healthy system for people to participate in, we can
      create serendipitous circumstances which foster new ideas and allow us to
      take advantage of the opportunities we generate. I value transparency,
      honesty, accountability, and open-mindedness in myself and in my
      relationships both personally and professionally.
