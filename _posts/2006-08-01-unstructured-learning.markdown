Structured learning sucks.

Let me be slightly more clear; systems within a structured environment impede passion and ones ability to be creative. A recent articles in psychology today reported on how children aren't learning necessary leadership and creative skills, because they aren't given enough freedoms when it comes to things like games and learning.

I have experienced first hand the consequences of this type of structured environment. I firmly believe that the education system failed me at an early age. I am not a prodigy of any sorts, but there was no _option_ to explore the interests I had when I was younger, simply because the system didn't alot enough or any time for it. (Aside: Modern education is failling, because it assumes that there is one solution for every individual - this is not the case)

So how can we move forward?

Would it be possible to create learning environments that provide rewarding feedback,Â  necessary failure, and most of all motivation? Would it be possible to create tools that have a very limited structure - something dynamic that would be able to conform to the learning habits that are unique to every individual?

I guess I'm sort of talking about an online learning platform, that adjusts to the style and habits of the user. Some people prefer all the facts in a big list at once, some don't. Some people prefer tiny details that lead up to big ideas. Some don't. Some people learn by seeing, others by doing, others by reading. By giving people and individuals the power to modify and enhance their own environment easily, you give them not only better tools for learning, but allow them to explore more possibilities.

After all, education is really about being open to new ideas.

Of course I have no answers to these questions. haha.
