You're starting a company, or you're managing and IT department.
Someone needs to keep the lights on, so you look to hire a Sysadmin, or a managed service provider (which is just a bunch of sysadmins paired with people who _dont_ know how to speak Klingon)

Pause, and ask yourself the following question:

"Do I want a Sysadmin? Or do I want a Developer who knows how to be a Sysadmin?"

Turns out there are quite a few developers who also know how to do operations work and do so really effectively. The people who do this kind of work have had all sorts of titles: Systems Engineers, Systems Administrators, Unlucky Developers, Operations, etc. 

You want someone who can automate backups, and testing of those backups in a way that removes themselves as bottlenecks. You want someone who can write the API you need for your developers to push code updates _every single hour_ to QA and production, and do so in a reliable fashion (with rollback)

These are the people you want to hire. 
Trust me.

The key question you have to ask yourself is this: 
"How many people does it take to keep my operation up and running 24x7?"

A 'decent' sysadmin can handle more than 50 computers on their own
A 'good' sysadmin can handle more than 200
An 'Awesome' sysadmin can handle more than 1000. 

The new name for this role is is 'DevOps' for Developer + Operations. They're people who keep lights on, and ensure that you'll keep the lights on if you get 1,000,000 customers tomorrow. The kind of people who will work themselves out of a job because they've automated *everything*. The kind of people who actually enjoy writing code that manages other computers. Yep. They actually exist.

Stop asking for what you think you want. There's a whole other class of developer out there - begging for a challenge.
