I read on the [AdHack blog](http://adhack2.com/home/blogpost/2631-1177) today that [Giant Ant Media](http://www.giantantmedia.com/index.php) was featured on YouTube's front page. They're the people who are behind the popular '[How to Shower: Women vs. Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qehxjub5lyo&NR=1)' vid, as well as a few other cool stop-animation movies online. Combined with sites like AdHack, this is the kind of enthusiastic creative media that will change what we think about advertising. Their website needs a little work though - anyone got some cycles to spare? 




These guys are awesome.
