Vancouver in the winter is like a mass experiment in light deprivation. Everyone is pretty miserable, because we get about 7 and a half hours of light a day - most of which is spent being a worker-bee (bleck). The recent weather hasn't exactly made Vancouverites the most cheery bunch of people in the world, myself included.

It's hard getting out of a miserable slump, but a little bit of sunshine and exercise makes things a hell of a lot better. So I'm walking down the street thinking about how good things are going when someone yells at me in an enthusiastic voice

'Hey do you want a free hug!?'

Fuck yes.

Nothing puts a grin on my face like people being super friendly. I loved it. Every last second. All in all I scored 4 free hugs - because when one hugger saw I was willing, I got bombarded. Lots of the other people getting hugs were asking questions like "Whats the catch?", of course there was none.

I'm pretty happy still and I got my hugs about 8 hours ago.

I have no idea who you guys were and I'll probably never find out - but Kudos to you. You guys are fucking awesome.
