I haven't had an email exchange quite as humorous or entertaining as the one you're about to read. Traditionally, I've ignored people who write to me in ALL CAPS, while using poor grammar, however I just couldn't hold back this time. The following is a conversation that took place between me and someone claiming to be starting a VoIP company on craigslist.

Ged,

You seem rather anxious, and I'm not quite sure if you understand that
writing to someone in all caps, is generally regarded as hostile. Your
lack of grammar and spelling skills also makes me question your age /
education level.
I dont say this to be mean, rather - I simply require more information
as to who YOU are and what you and your partner are capable of doing.

Are you financially supporting this project?
Are you a person with a technical or business background?
How much experience do you have with technology?

If you can answer those questions then maybe we can work together.
