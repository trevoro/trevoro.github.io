Today the Canadian Space Agency started a [recruitment campaign](http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/astronauts/selection.asp) for the next set of astronauts. From the website

_"The Canadian Space Agency is seeking outstanding scientists, engineers and/or medical doctors with a wide variety of backgrounds. Creativity, diversity, teamwork, and a probing mind are qualities required to join the Canadian Space Agency's Astronaut Corps. To withstand the physical demands of training and space flight, candidates must also demonstrate a high level of fitness and a clean bill of health."_

I decided to got through the sign up process. Interestingly enough, the first skill testing question was a CAPTCHA. Seriously - What the fuck point would there be for a BOT to sign up to become an astronaut?

Typical questions may include

Whats the furthest distance you've been from home?

Do you easily become nauseous?

Are you comfortable peeing into a tube?Â But seriously, it's pretty cool that we're recruiting for astronauts on the internet. Space travel seems so casual now, but still very very elite. I guess I'll have to wait until they start mining turbinium on mars.
