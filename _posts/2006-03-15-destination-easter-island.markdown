Well this is to be my last post for another month. Not that I've been writing anywhere near as regularly as I'd hope to be. Monday (Sunday for most of you) will be the day that the Soren Larsen, the crew and myself leave Auckland, New Zealand to sail for Easter Island. We'll be leaving and sailling down into the roaring 40's, and the [Southern Ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean). The passage will be around 35 days or so, and we should be arriving at Easter by the end of April. I've set aside a few days of exploring there for myself, and then I'll be flying into Chile to spend a little bit of time in Santiago, and then it's back to the true north strong and free to enjoy what I hope to be a fantastic summer! 

New Zealand was fun, but let's face it. Canada kicks way too much ass for me to be here, and like one of my friends said before, I have way too many different interests to devote myself purely to one thing. I feel that I can better accomplish those things back home.

That and I've ran out of money.

But who cares! I'll be back soon, so get ready, because I'll be coming by to crash on your couches, drink your beer and play your video games. (Somebody better have an xbox 360 and a big DLP tv by the time I get back)

Wish us luck! I'll be thinking about everyone on the trip!
