Gary Vaynerchuk of WineLibrary.TV spoke at Web2.0 expo and manages to give what I consider the best piece of advice that too few people hear. Too many people work jobs they hate so they can buy stuff they don't need, all the while longing to do something else.

The short and sweet of it: Do what you love, stop bitching about hard work, and find the time to build things you care about.
