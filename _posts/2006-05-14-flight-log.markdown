I don't actually remember writing any of these notes down, and at the moment I feel way to lazy to flesh it out, so I'm going to post them in their raw form.

"All male flight attendents are gay. This is a fact.
I dont know if the started out that way or if sucking
cock for a job has forced them to it as an extracurricular
activity.

Texans sound just like they do in the movies. And they drink 
a lot. And talk about exploiting people as a hobby.

The seats in first class are large because the passengers are fat.
Everyone in economy is thinking about how comfortable they must be. But they
aren't. They use up ALL the space in their seats.
They're also extremely snobby people. They assume because they've sat down
nobody else will board the plane. They're wrong. And fat.
Did I mention they were fat?

Anyone flying through America has to clear customs. Somehow Canadians citizens
are exempt from having to fill out additional forms and have their eyes scanned.

The gay flight attendants are a minor nuisance. I'll put up with a couple 
glances at my ass for free bloody mary's. Especially when its 5$US for a shot of vodka. It's a far cry from South America. That's for sure.

Brazillian women are gorgeous.
Argentine women are gorgeous.
Chilean women are gorgeous. 

Airline food always... surprises me.

Good TV clip about an autistic kid that played highschool basketball."
