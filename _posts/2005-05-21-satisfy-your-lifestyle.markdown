I was partying with a [friend](http://www.puffyedge.com) last night and he said something in passing that probably deserved more attention. It was one of those things you hear that sort of removes you from your reality. 

"Satisfy your lifestyle, everything else comes second."

After hearing that, it was almost as though everything went silent, and I was alone with my thoughts for what was really just a few seconds, but what may have seemed like an eternity. During that time I was able to analyze a choice I'd made (I'm being vague on purpose), and feel confident about it. Satisfy your lifestyle. What do you really want to do? All the other things are there to support your lifestyle, not vice-versa. It's entirely too easy to get caught up in the every day and forget the actual reason you first started making sacrifices.
