I was able to check out [Rambo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462499/) a day early yesterday courtesy of [John Bollwitt](http://audihertz.net/blog) (Thanks Buddy). Okay, lets get a few things out of the way.

Anyone can appreciate an awesome movie, but to appreciate a sequel 22 years in the making you have to acknowledge a few things.

1) It's probably going to suck (In terms of movie-epic-ness)

2) The actors will be older - There's only so much 'movie magic' can do

3) It will be bloody. Bloody good.

4) You're older too and therefore more judgemental

5) You must suspend your disbelief

I followed my own advice and went in to the theatre with honest expectations. So what do I think?

Rambo

Fucking

Rocks

Sylvester Stallone makes absolutely no apologies. This movie is terribly awesome, with people being gutted, heads being blown off, people being blown up by landmines, ancient unrealistic bombs and jeep-mounted machine guns. Yes people.

Bask in all it's glory gore and appreciate Rambo for what it is - A cheesy bloody action movie.
