I'm so sorry that I can't write everyone a great email wishing them the best over the holidays - So I'm going to do it here.

**HAPPY HOLIDAYS!**

Yay!

Enjoy spending time with family and friends! 
Throw snowballs at passing cars!
Drink insane amounts of liquor!
Wake up Christmas morning with a hangover!
and most of all
Drink one for me!

All the Best,

      Trevor
