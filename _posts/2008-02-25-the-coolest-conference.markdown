I've only been to a handful of conferences, so I suppose I don't have too much of a basis for comparison, but nobody can convince me that TED isn't the coolest conference ever. TED 2008 starts tomorrow and this year's topic is "The Big Questions". Those questions are

Who are we?
What is our place in the universe?
What is life?
Is beauty truth?
Will evil prevail?
How can we change the world?
How do we create?
What's out there?
What will tomorrow bring?
What stirs us?
How dare we be optimistic?
And the point?

A little technical, a little philosophical and all of them very exciting. I hope this years talks don't take too long to squeak their way onto the interwebs.

I had my ear to the ground but it seems like the [BIL](http://bilconference.com/) conference (heh) has got a lot of traction.

The first (hopefully annual) conference is being held in Monterey, California and is free to attend and open to the public. BIL is a self-organizing conference with a handful of corporate sponsors. Does anyone want to rent a car and drive to California this weekend? :)
