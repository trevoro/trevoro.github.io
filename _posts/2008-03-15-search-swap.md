Today I realized that I’ve been using the search bar about 100x as much as the
address bar in my browser. I got to thinking about how I’d like to see the
address bar and search bar in Firefox, swap places.  The only reason people type
in URLS, is because they know what they want, and most of the time you’ll have
that address in your history bar. 

When was the last time you typed in a URL that was longer than 24 characters?
