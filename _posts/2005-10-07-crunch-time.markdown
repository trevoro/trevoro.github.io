Well its crunch time.

I've been travelling around a country on the other side of the World for awhile, and I've done a lot of really cool new things. Unfortunately, that all costs money - meaning its time to start looking for work.  It's actually having a greater impact on my decision making process than I originally thought it would. All of the sudden IT employers seem less and less interested in my CV. (Probably just because I'm more interested in finding work.) 
Which raises a couple of interesting issues. 
If I cannot find work here in New Zealand I'll probably use my ticket I've got to Australia and work there for a year. Bouncing around on a working holiday visa. Australia only allows you to work for an employer for 3 months at a time - meaning I'd have to work at at least 4 places if I chose to max out the visa itself. 

**Pros**

* Its WARMER


* More Surfing (Which I still haven't done yet)


* Better Money


* Cheaper flights to Asia


**Cons**

* I probably wouldn't be working in the IT industry - I dont want to lose my 31337 hax0r skillz. ;)


* 3 months is _just_ enough time to get really good at something. (pro/con)


* Its scary! (Maybe this is also a good thing...)


* Leaving some people behind - Always painful.


Regardless - I have the option. The possibilities are limitless. I could be a barrista, a internet cafe patron (eww), work at a harbour, kill fishies, be a bartender, be a waitor, anything really...

I guess the problem is making that decision. But as a card-carrying procrastinator, I know that if I keep putting off that decision I'll be left with only one option. Oddly enough that makes things easier. Time makes my decisions for me - but they're not always the best ones.
I mean you're never _really_ in charge of your life until you have nothing motivating or influencing your decisions - Whether that be a job, school, money, relationships, family, friends, etc. (Although friends can sometimes be motivating in the right ways!). I guess my requirements for what qualify as 'motivations' have been stripped down to the simple and raw 'what I need to live and be happy' stage. And what I need to be happy has been stripped bare.  So back to the decision making process - It's really about realizing that waiting for "The Inevitable" doesn't necessarily mean that it was the only "Inevitable". Any moment is another chance to turn it all around.

Hi everyone!
