Earlier this month, McDonalds started hadning out Humvee toys in Happy Meals. Way to go Corporate Responsibility!

[RonaldMcHummer](http://www.ronaldmchummer.com) has a petition option that will submit emails to McDonalds, telling them how retarded you think they are, and they also include a fancy script that lets you customize your very own McDonalds sign! Yay!
