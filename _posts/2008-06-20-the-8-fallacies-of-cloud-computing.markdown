This old list of the fallacies of grid computing needs revisiting in the new cloud computing space. I believe this list was originally written by [Peter Deutsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch), but I can't find his original post.

Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application, makes the following eight assumptions. All prove to be false in the long run and all cause _big_ trouble and _painful_ learning experiences.



	
  * The network is reliable

	
  * Latency is zero

	
  * Bandwidth is infinite

	
  * The network is secure

	
  * Topology doesn't change

	
  * There is one administrator

	
  * Transport cost is zero

	
  * The network is homogeneous
