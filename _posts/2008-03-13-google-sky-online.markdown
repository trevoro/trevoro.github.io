Google Sky is online now - you don't need Google Earth to browse the heavens. I expect this to be part of every science class curriculum from now on. Now that everyone has access to this kind of data (w/ zoom!) it means that amateur astronomers can help catalog and identify phenomenon. Never underestimate the power of the crowd!



Is nice.
